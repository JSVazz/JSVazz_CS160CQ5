Mars Exploration Time complexity: O(n). This code has a time complexity of linear because 
there is only 1 for loop. This means that we only need to go through each value in the string 1 time.


Mars Exploration Space complexity: O(c). This code has a space complexity of constant because
the input we take is never adjusted or change while the code is running. It is only scanned by the code
to check if certain characters have been changed.
